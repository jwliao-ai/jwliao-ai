## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an senior undergrad majoring in AI at Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (IAIR) in Xi'an Jiaotong University. I was a visiting student at University of California, Berkeley 2023 Fall.

Currently I am an RA on RL and LLM-based Agent advised by Weinan Zhang at APEX in Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

I was once a research assistant intern on Deep Reinforcement Learning, RLHF and Federated Learning in Ju Ren's group at Depart. of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University from Sep. 2023 to Apr. 2024.

I'm interested in Deep Reinforcement Learning, Large Decision Models and Agent Tech.
